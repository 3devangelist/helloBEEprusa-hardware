# BETA community tester updates 
I have forke the base project because of a friend of mine is a beta tester of beeverycreative, but he has some problems with the printer and asks for help since I am a BEE ambassador.

## Problems
The X-axis doesn't reach to the break of the end stop, causing some skipping noise of the GT2 Belt. For these the break as to be a little wider like 3 mm bigger.
